# Project Description

    The theme we have chosen for this project is Healthy Food. For this particular task our group has come to an agreement to start a mock organization. Robust Food is a non-profit organization which aims to promote and spread awareness about the importance of nutritious food in our life. Our organization also collects donations to help people in need for food. Our big mission is to promote a healthy lifestyle to the communities by consuming healthy food and realizing Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Goal 3: Good Well Being of Sustainable Goal Development. In order to implement it, we have decided to create a website where anyone can access the information of healthy food and share their healthy recipes.

    Our website consists of five main pages which are home, recipe, donation, about us and contact us. We have chosen a few fonts to be inside our website which are helvetica, microsoft yahei and verdana. We are designing web pages with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse the users. We will make sure our website is easy to navigate and not produce any confusion. On top of that, we chose to use an analogous color scheme to create a rich, monochromatic look for our website.

      Our website provides a recipes page which is mainly for promoting healthy foods and guiding users through the journey of healthy cooking. No matter what food allergy, food intolerance or food sensitivity that the user has, they still can enjoy wholesome and delicious food. Fast forward to today, consumers are more health savvy and place more emphasis on the nutritional values, varieties, look and taste of healthy food. In addition the food we provide is totally halal food following standards of the Ministry of Health and is prepared in accordance with hygiene standards and health rules under periodic supervision  of specialists. 

    Besides that, our website also provides a donation page which can be used to encourage people to be involved in the donation project. We provided a donation form which will help in collecting money from users. The money gained from the payment donation will be used to make foods to be distributed.
